B2B E-commerce module is currently being used by Nimble Growth’s customers via an Android app with backend on WordPress. The Product Traceability module is currently being managed via a Project Management tool. However, the reason behind the decision of revamping the complete system is that Nimble Growth is in need of an omni-channel platform with singular database structure for future scalability and adaptability.",
